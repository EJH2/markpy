# SimPy-Markdown

This is a Python port of [Khan's simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown). The only reason this exists
is because I didn't want to write another project's backend in Node. I have attempted a 1-1 parallel, but due to the
nature of JS and Python's differences in RegEx, there is no 100% guarantee.

## Using

Use this exactly how you would use simple-markdown, except everything is snake_case instead of camelCase. It's just
that easy!
